My first steps in learning Automation
using Selenium and JS
writing tests for https://www.saucedemo.com/
using [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZMWkkQEwOPl0udc9Dap2NbEAkwkdOTV3) for basic info 

test cases are in excel file 'test cases.xlsx'
to run tests use in terminal: npm test 
new html report is generated after each test run in 'mochawesome-report/testResults.html'
